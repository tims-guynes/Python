--COMBAT--
-----------------------------------------------
The blood of your foes stain your hands and armor
You question your decisions on if there may have
Been a different way to not lose so many lives.
While you exit your thoughts have distracted you
That you had not realized that the exit you found
Was you waking up, in shackles and naked.
-----------------------------------------------
--TALK--
-----------------------------------------------
After making so many friends and talking your 
Way through, you find that each one had a precious
Moment that they shared even if it was a simple 
Gesture. You wonder though if that was really the
Best way to accomplish your quest, but it's too 
Late now. As you follow the exit you found, you 
Lose track of your surroundings while depe in 
Thought. After a few moments it seems, you realized
You are actually waking up, hungry and wishing you
Could go back to your dream as that was better then
The pain of hunger.
-----------------------------------------------
--SNEAK--
-----------------------------------------------
Slinking through each encounter, you have been able
To avoid all the encounters. Like that of a rat, you
Found the easiest way around the conflicts. While 
Moving towards the exit you hear a SNAP and a sharp 
Pain on your leg. Waking up, screaming because of this
You realize that it was nothing more than a dream.
Getting up and finding your way to a basin where you 
Keep your clean water, you splash your face to clear 
The sweat and sleep in your eyes. Thinking on the dream
You wonder if it really was a dream after all.
