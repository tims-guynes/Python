--Entering Encounter--
-----------------------------------------------
Onward you go, feeling something dark and omnious.
As you look around, you start to see the darkness dance and shift. 
Moments after you noticed this, you see what looks to be tattered fabric
Swirlling around a place in front of you then stop as now a White door 
Stands in front of you to the left.
Taken aback from this situation, you notice just to the right that there is
A vague outline of something. As you focus your attention, you notice that 
There is another door, this one black as the environment you're in and hardly
Noticeable. As you keep looking, the door on the right becomes more obvious.
Which do you choose to enter?
-----------------------------------------------
--LEFT DOOR--White Door Dragon encounter
-----------------------------------------------
Once you reach the door, you feel an ominous pressence just behind the door.
You steel yourself as you are reminded you've made it this far, there's no turning back.
As you open the door you can feel the warmth of the air
Wafting with the sent of brimstone and death, you're not sure this is a good idea after all
Turning around, the door you came through is no longer there.
You hear echoing in what looks to be a cavern open with the center lit with what looks to be a dragon
'Pesky mortal, I do not appreciate trespassers'
-----------------------------------------------
--RIGHT DOOR--Black Door Dragon slayed encounter
-----------------------------------------------
As you open the door, you notice that the smell is pungent and putrid, as though something has rotted
Looking around, you notice the dead corpse of what once was a dragon in the middle of the cavern 
Unsure of how things came to be, you think that if something could take this beast down
It's best to not linger.
As you wander, you find what looks to be a party engaged in battle
Moments later you see a large blade rise and swipe this group cutting them down.
Before you stands a creature with the torso of a man, red and sheen like leather
Large horns adorn his head
With legs that look like they are part of a goat.
