--BANDIT
-----------------------------------------------
As you walk through the red door you notice a Bandit
Rummaging through bags and crates
Unaware of your pressence and focused on his task you go
Unnoticed. 
What do you do?
-----------------------------------------------
--Talk--
OH, you startled me, you know you shouldn't be sneaking up
On people. 
Here, take this and leave me be.
