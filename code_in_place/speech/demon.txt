--DEMON-- 
-----------------------------------------------
Walking through yet another door on your unending quest it seems.
You notice that the air has a putrid and rotting nature to it.
This smell is so strong you find it difficult to keep from wretching
Once you collect yourself, you start to explore to see if you can find an exit
After a few moments, you see a light almost like a way to the outside.
As you move towards the possible exit, you see a figure next to an outline of a large lizard or dragon
The figure turns towards your direction but doesn't seem to have noticed you
Before you, you see what looks to be a demon, with a torso red and slick, large horns adorn its head 
And legs that resemble that of a goat.
Watching this demon, you see that it's just walking back and forth between an area you cannot see
And the corpse of the dragon
What do you do?
-----------------------------------------------
--Talk--
-----------------------------------------------
How cute, you want to talk pathetic mortal.
I guess this is a little entertaining.
You are not worth my effort so begon, your exit is there
