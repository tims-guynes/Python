Welcome Traveler
You have are fortunate to have stumbled upon two weapons to help you fight on your quest
Please choose one to take
-----------------------------------------------
Now that you have your weapon
As you have regained your senses you notice two paths in front of you
The door to the left looks forboding and univiting like it has been tainted by something
The door to the west is well kept and in prestine condition.
Which do you choose?
Left? Right? 
---left door--- START path 0
As you venture into the tainted door, 
You notice as you touch the door to open it, 
The handle starts to crumble to dust 
Afterward the door creeks open with a sound that sends shivvers down your spine 
And a chill so deep that it feels like your bones hurt
Once you have cleared your head enough to search the surrounding area 
You noticed that you're in a marshland now and you notice a defineable path
Travelling down this path for some time, 
you notice a goblin on the path you are travelling not too far
As you come closer the goblin has yet to notice you
What do you do?
-----------------------------------------------
---right door--- START path 0
-----------------------------------------------
After the goblin gives you the item he wanders off
In his place two more doors appear. 
This time you see the door on the left is a Blue door, 
Almost like watching a body of water
As it ripples and shifts in color from light to dark.
The Right door is green, similar to the other door, 
This shifts in colors like leaves in the wind from
Light green to dark green.
Which do you choose?
-----------------------------------------------
---path 1---
-----------------------------------------------
After your previous encounter, two more doors appear like some force
Is watching and offering you a fast way to make these choices.
Looking upon the doors you can see that the left is red, almost like
It's soaked in Blood.
The right has an orange hue from the edges like there's a strong 
source of light behind it.
Which do you choose?
-----------------------------------------------
As you go through the door, things seem more tranquil, almost like there's
A magical pressence beckoning you. 
Looking around you notice a chest.
As you open it, you find that there are a pair of grieves. 
Putting them on you notice not only do they fit perfectly
They also have a warmth to them.
A short while you hear rumbling and two new doors burst from the ground
The left door 
---path 2---
