--ELF-- 
-----------------------------------------------
The sounds of music and nature fill the area.
Looking around you notice that the structure looks almost like it was grown
Fletching arrows you notice an elf minding their own while working.
You can see that there seems to be hundreds of arrows 
as the elf puts another onto the pile and continues fletching.
What do you do?

Why are you bothering me
Here, take this and leave me
I am far too busy for the likes of you
