As you venture into the tainted door, 
You notice as you touch the door to open it, 
The handle starts to crumble to dust 
Afterward the door creeks open with a sound that sends shivvers down your spine 
And a chill so deep that it feels like your bones hurt
Once you have cleared your head enough to search the surrounding area 
You noticed that you're in a marshland now and you notice a defineable path
Travelling down this path for some time, 
you notice a goblin on the path you are travelling not too far
As you come closer the goblin has yet to notice you
What do you do?

After the goblin gives you the item he wanders off
In his place two more doors appear. 
This time you see the door on the left is a Blue door, 
Almost like watching a body of water
As it ripples and shifts in color from light to dark.
The Right door is green, similar to the other door, 
This shifts in colors like leaves in the wind from
Light green to dark green.
Which do you choose?
